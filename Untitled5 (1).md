```python
def search_insert(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    
    return left  # Target not found, return the insertion index

# Example usage
sorted_array = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target_value = 5
print(search_insert(sorted_array, target_value))  # Output: 

target_value = 2
print(search_insert(sorted_array, target_value))  # Output: 

target_value = 7
print(search_insert(sorted_array, target_value))  # Output: 

target_value = 0
print(search_insert(sorted_array, target_value))  # Output:

```python
def add_binary(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    # Convert binary strings to integers, add them, and convert back to binary
    sum_binary = bin(int(a, 2) + int(b, 2))
    
    # The bin function adds a '0b' prefix, so we need to remove it
    return sum_binary[2:]

# Example usage
a = "1010"
b = "1011"
result = add_binary(a, b)
print(result)  # Output: "10101"

```

    10101
    
def add_binary(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    # Initialize pointers for both strings and a carry variable
    i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1
    carry = 0
    result = []

    # Loop until both strings are exhausted and there's no carry
    while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
        # Get the current bits to add (0 or 1), default to 0 if the index is out of bounds
        bit_a = int(a[i]) if i >= 0 else 0
        bit_b = int(b[j]) if j >= 0 else 0

        # Calculate the sum of the bits and the carry
        total = bit_a + bit_b + carry
        
        # The new bit is total % 2, and the new carry is total // 2
        result.append(str(total % 2))
        carry = total // 2

        # Move to the next bits
        i -= 1
        j -= 1

    # The result is currently reversed, so reverse it before joining
    return ''.join(reversed(result))

# Example usage
a = "11"
b = "1"
result = add_binary(a, b)
print(result)  # Output: "100"

```python
def single_number(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num  # Apply XOR for each number in the array
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [9, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,0 ,1]
result = single_number(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 

```

    9

```python
def find_repeated_dna_sequences(s: str):
    sequence_count = {}
    result = []

    # Iterate through the string with a window of size 10
    for i in range(len(s) - 9):  # len(s) - 9 ensures we have enough length for a 10-letter sequence
        sequence = s[i:i + 10]
        # Count the occurrences of each sequence
        if sequence in sequence_count:
            sequence_count[sequence] += 1
        else:
            sequence_count[sequence] = 1

    # Collect sequences that occur more than once
    for sequence, count in sequence_count.items():
        if count > 1:
            result.append(sequence)

    return result

# Example usage
s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
output = find_repeated_dna_sequences(s)
print(output)  # Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

    ['AAAAACCCCC', 'CCCCCAAAAA']
    


### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Create a dictionary `sequence_count` to keep track of how many times each 10-letter sequence appears, and a list `result` to store the repeated sequences.
2. **Sliding Window**: Loop through the DNA sequence using a range that ensures you can grab 10 characters at a time. For each starting index `i`, extract the substring of length 10.
3. **Count Sequences**: Update the count of each sequence in the dictionary.
4. **Collect Results**: After counting, iterate through the dictionary to collect sequences that occur more than once and add them to the result list.
5. **Return Results**: Finally, return the list of repeated sequences.

### How to Use
- Call the `find_repeated_dna_sequences` function with a DNA sequence string, and it will return a list of all 10-letter-long sequences that occur more than once.

This implementation runs in \( O(n) \) time complexity, where \( n \) is the length of the string, and it efficiently finds the repeated sequences. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
